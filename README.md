# MOOC-Statistics

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing the code of several hundred student submitted code to a MOOC. We are attempting to analyze the code base of several hundred submitted code samples to a MOOC that was recently offered. The information we currently have access to is the students' code, forum comments, country, level of education, age, employment status, course scores, and IP address. The interesting part of this analysis is because MOOCs are still relatively new and we are not sure what can be learned from this large amount of information. We hope to learn as much as possible from these such as finding code clones or certain patterns not only within the code but also across demographics or other divides. We can also check for the code's safety, any frameworks used, or their final scalability.

## The Heilmeier questions:
### What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. What is the problem? Why is it hard?
We are attempting to analyze the code base of several hundred submitted code samples to a MOOC that was recently offered. The information we currently have access to is the students' code, forum comments, country, level of education, age, employment status, course scores, and IP address. The interesting part of this analysis is because MOOCs are still relatively new and we are not sure what can be learned from this large amount of information. We hope to learn as much as possible from these such as finding code clones or certain patterns not only within the code but also across demographics or other divides. We can also check for the code's safety, any frameworks used, or their final scalability. 

The main challenge of this project is that MOOCs are new and a large amount of code is to be analyzed to better understand the significance of running MOOCs. Not only must the code be analyzed in an intelligent way, but we must also define patterns and other metrics to be examined with significance. Do coders from region have different style than another? Are there signficiant commonalities across demographics? Is there code or pattern duplication among submissions? These are the questions we hope to answer and more. 

### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
(to be added)

### What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Newness in approach comes from a large amount of code being reviewed from hundreds of users rather than dozens from single class. 

### Who cares?
Those who are interested in running their own MOOCs and statisticians. 

### If you're successful, what difference will it make? What impact will success have? How will it be measured?
### What are the risks and the payoffs?
### How much will it cost?
### How long will it take?
### What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?
